<p>Its okay to upload modified versions to our discord in the channel <span class="wrapperHover-1GktnT wrapper-3WhCwL" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="VIP Patrons">#vip-uploads-mods</span>. Its okay to modify the AddOns for personal / commercial use in your own projects.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Piracy</h2>
<p><strong>Never</strong>, <strong>ever</strong> share the AddOn links, the packaged AddOns or the raw AddOn source to non-Patrons or Patrons of lower tiers. <em>Doing this will slowly but for sure decompose the whole AddOn Endeavour and finally make us quit.</em></p>
<p>A community-member who is violating these rules will be expelled from the community and permanently banned from both Discord and Patreon. A DCMA complaint will be placed against any public download site where the AddOns are made available. In addition we are able to enforce international law if required.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">Unity can act weird at times, especially when using lots of assets in one project. My AddOns for example use &#8220;Scripting Define Symbols&#8221; a lot, in order to detect if another AddOn is installed or not.</span></p>
<div class="sc-1di2uql-0 Pjwq sc-1sp3zau-0 kvIAEs" data-tag="post-content">
<p>Sometimes, this causes a lockup as Unity is looking for such a &#8220;Scripting Define Symbol&#8221; before the AddOn had a chance to add it (thats usually a red error in the console log). In that case, its always a good idea to clear your Scripting Define Symbols.</p>
<p>After this has been done, most of the weird errors usually dis-appear.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your Player Settings via the Menu:<br />Edit -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Player</li>
<li>Look for the &#8220;Scripting Define Symbols&#8221; section in your Player Settings.</li>
<li>Select all the text, delete it. And afterwards press Return, Unity will now rebuild all Scripting Define Symbols.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.6em;">Scripting Define Symbols</span></p>
<div class="sc-1di2uql-0 Pjwq sc-1sp3zau-0 kvIAEs" data-tag="post-content">
<p>Sometimes, when importing AddOns there are red errors in the console, even though there are no errors in the script. This could be because of Scripting Define Symbols not refreshed properly. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/scripting-define-21320336">Check my other post on how to solve that, it will save you from a lot of trouble!</a> </p>
<hr />
<h2>Importing/Removing and Re-Importing AddOns</h2>
<p>You have to remember: When you add an AddOn, the Scripting Define Symbols will be added to your project. Now, when you remove that AddOn, the Scripting Define Symbols <strong>stay in there </strong>&#8211; but the AddOn is not available anymore. This will also cause errors! Again: You should clear the Scripting Define Symbols (as explained above) when removing AddOns.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Database Lock / No such Column</h2>
<p>The database tables/columns change from time to time when I add new functionality to my AddOns. Sometimes this throws a &#8220;no such column&#8221; error in the console or the database ends up locked. In that case you should delete your <strong>database file</strong> as well as the <strong>journal file</strong> if there is one. Both are located in your project folder.</p>
<p><em>Please note that this will delete all your player data in a live project as well. In that case you have to add/update your database manually.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/patreon-media/p/post/21428872/8c164c1ef0b043a28c855c80b7555438/1.png?token-time=1573689600&amp;token-hash=t2Ik4CiykQcgCeu8tA8l_SRSaR8JItTu-UjfeIAlVL8%3D" data-media-id="11804403" /></p>
<hr />
<h2>No Text in UI of UCE AddOns</h2>
<p>Several of my AddOns feature editable text colors. If you wonder that no text shows up at all, take a look at the corresponding UI element in your canvas. When exporting a package using Unity, the colors do not export correctly and appear as 100% transparent. Set transparency manually to make your text show up correctly, sadly there is not much I can do about this.</p>
<h2>Network Spawning Related Errors</h2>
<p>Many network errors happen when you forget to add game objects to your Network Manager registered spawnable prefabs. You must add all objects that can be spawned by any means to that list (this includes visual skill effects), otherwise you will get errors sooner or later. Check the inspector of your NetworkManagerMMO and add all spawnable game objects to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/patreon-media/p/post/21428872/9e9075acfbd74f928f1d07066f2a2860/1.png?token-time=1573689600&amp;token-hash=0hP8NqLig_Y5ki890ciBLa6o_i7IFO2NTq9M2fJFhPM%3D" data-media-id="11804458" /></p>
<hr />
<h2>Creating New Objects</h2>
<p>From my personal experience: Whenever I try to create a competely new Skill or Item, it fails. Therefore I always <strong>duplicate</strong> an existing Item or Skill and then change the properties.</p>
<p>This is even more important to prefabs like Monsters, Pets and Players. Whenever I try to create one from scratch, it fails. This results in very strange bugs that are hard to track down. Why does this happen? Check the Inspector of a Player for example, see how many components there are and how many settings? Its so complex that it is very easy to overlook something.</p>
<p><em>Always duplicate one of the default objects like the Skeleton, the Warrior, the Baby Skeleton or any of the Items and/or Skills and use it as your new template !</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>The Resources Folder</h2>
<p>Make sure to always have just <strong>one</strong> <strong>Resources</strong> folder in your project and <strong>never</strong> have any <strong>duplicates</strong> of the same name. This is especially important with my AddOns as most come with new Items and Skills: You have to move them to your main Resources folder, while not keeping the original ones.</p>
<p>uMMORPG uses a internal dictionary to keep track of all Items and Skills. It scans the main resources folder for those objects. If you don&#8217;t keep all your objects in the main Resources folder, that scan will fail and the objects will not be in the Dictionary. This will sooner or later cause errors in your project.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Try on a Blank Project First</h2>
<p>I always recommend that you maintain at least 2 unity projects: Your main game project and a secondary project that only contains uMMORPG as well as my AddOns. Try adding new AddOns to the blank project first and see if you can get everything to work correctly. Then, you can add it to your main game project.</p>
<p><em>This is also very important for error reports: Lots of errors arise if you combine my AddOns with too many other AddOns or Unity Assets that affect how things work in general. It is very difficult for me to analyze your problem if you don&#8217;t try the AddOn on a blank project first.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>AddOn Installation Errors</h2>
<p>Finally, make sure to read the <strong>ReadMe&#8217;s</strong> of your freshly imported AddOns! Some AddOns require core changes, and if you don&#8217;t apply them, they will cause errors. Be sure to check the ReadMe and follow all checks before posting a error report on the Discord Server &#8211; thank you!</p>
<hr />
<h2>Errors after Official Update</h2>
<p>Every time you update uMMORPG to the latest version, it will overwrite all changes made to your core files. In addition, the Scripting Defines will be messed up. You will have to re-apply all core changes again and clear your scripting defines, as explained above.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Errors after Switching Build Target</h2>
<p>Clear your scripting defines to solve those errors. The Scripting Defines are unique for each one of your target builds.</p>
