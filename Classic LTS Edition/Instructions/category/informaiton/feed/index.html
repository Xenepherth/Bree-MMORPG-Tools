<p>Our website has finished updating to the new design and layout! Thank you everyone for being patient with us as we went through these changes. We&#8217;ve added a great new feature to our website called: Knowledge Base. This is a searchable database of information we&#8217;ve stored, we will be housing all of our old readmes on the website moving forward as instructions in the Knowledge Base. We also added a FAQ section which will be populated in the near future.<br><br>We&#8217;ve also updated all of our addons, excluding UMA, UMA Editor, and Item Levels, to the most current version of v1.179 that had the large database changes to sqlite. Which provided a huge performance increase, so anyone utilizing sqlite should move to this version as soon as possible.<br><br>Another note to make is from this point on will only be keeping our downloads on the website as to not only make it easier to locate them and update them but to also increase security. We&#8217;ve had a good portion of incidents lately that have involved individuals posting the link from our discord up on the internet. This devalues our product and our efforts greatly, so we decided that it was time to add a little more security. We do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause individuals but we hope you understand where we&#8217;re coming from. We also set it so you must be logged in, in order to download any of our addons or assets moving forward. This is also a security enhancement for the website to make sure no one is by passing purchasing our addons and assets.<br><br>Everyone to keep in mind there will be some changes in the discord with channel arrangement and usage. Due to the website changes and some other changes that will be taking affect a little later down the road.<br><br>As promised we did however keep backups of our addons for v1.177, as this was the most popular version request, on our website. They&#8217;re available to Regular members at this time. This is because we don&#8217;t want to condone pirating of assets, addons, software, or really anything in general as it&#8217;s unlawful. By providing a large database of backups for older versions we would be leaving them open for older versions of uMMORPG 3d which have been none to be pirated. We will not condone such behaviour and will not help provide addons, assets, or support for such behaviour either. So with that being said we do understand that their are still a good chunk of individuals that don&#8217;t wish to update at this time to the newest version, which we understand. So we will always keep one backup available for incidents like this, this also means that this backup will eventually move forward as uMMORPG 3d updates.<br><br>Our addons for uMMORPG 2d will be coming to the website here in the near future, for the time being they will stay available through discord. We would estimate that they will be moved to our website and removed from discord in a weeks time, so prepare for that change as well.<br><br>Happy Developing Everyone!</p>
