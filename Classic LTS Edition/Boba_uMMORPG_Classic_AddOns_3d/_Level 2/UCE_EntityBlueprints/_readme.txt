Introduction

When working with a large number of Entities (especially Monsters) it can be tedious to
edit all the stats (like Health, Mana, Crit Rate etc.) by hand on each one.

This AddOn allows you to assign one or more templates to each Entity and then copy-paste
all stats from the combined templates onto a Entity prefab.

All the functionality of this AddOn takes place inside the Editor only!

Installation

1. Edit/add any number of blueprints to this AddOns "Blueprints" folder.
2. The blueprints do NOT have to be inside the Resources folder of your project and they
should NOT as this would include them in the build (we dont want that).
3. Select any ENTITY (Monster, Pet, Player, etc.) and assign one or more blueprints to it.
4. Click the "Apply Blueprints" button in the editor to summarize and paste all stats from
all assigned blueprints.
